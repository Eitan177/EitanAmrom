        "This code filters a Pandas DataFrame (`combined_df`) based on several criteria applied to each unique tumor sample barcode. Let's break down the process step-by-step:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization:**\n",
        "   - An empty list `filtered_dfs` is created to store the filtered dataframes for each barcode.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iteration over Unique Barcodes:**\n",
        "   - The code iterates through each unique value in the 'Tumor_Sample_Barcode' column of `combined_df`.  This ensures that the filtering is applied independently to each sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Filtering Data for Each Barcode:**\n",
        "   - **`barcode_df = combined_df[combined_df['Tumor_Sample_Barcode'] == barcode]`**: For the current barcode, it extracts all rows from `combined_df` where the 'Tumor_Sample_Barcode' matches the barcode being processed in the loop.  This creates a subset DataFrame (`barcode_df`) containing only the data for that specific barcode.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **`filtered_barcode_df = barcode_df[...]`**: This line performs the core filtering. It applies three conditions to `barcode_df`:\n",
        "     - `(barcode_df['AF'] < 20)`: Allele frequency ('AF') must be less than 20.\n",
        "     - `(barcode_df['AF'] > 2)`: Allele frequency ('AF') must be greater than 2.\n",
        "     - `(barcode_df['DP'] > 200)`: Depth of coverage ('DP') must be greater than 200.\n",
        "\n",
        "     The `&` operator combines these conditions, meaning that a row is included in `filtered_barcode_df` only if *all three* conditions are true.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Appending to the Filtered List:**\n",
        "   - **`if not filtered_barcode_df.empty:`**:  This check is crucial. It verifies that the filtering process actually produced some results for the current barcode. If `filtered_barcode_df` is empty (meaning no rows met all three filter criteria), the code avoids appending an empty DataFrame to the list.  This prevents errors later on.\n",
        "   - **`filtered_dfs.append(filtered_barcode_df)`**: If `filtered_barcode_df` is not empty, it's added to the `filtered_dfs` list.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Concatenation and Output:**\n",
        "   - **`if filtered_dfs:`**: After processing all barcodes, this condition checks if the `filtered_dfs` list contains any DataFrames.  If the list is not empty, it means at least one barcode had data that passed the filtering steps.\n",
        "   - **`final_df = pd.concat(filtered_dfs)`**: All the filtered DataFrames in `filtered_dfs` are combined into a single DataFrame `final_df`.\n",
        "   - **`print(final_df)`**: The resulting `final_df`, containing all rows that passed the filter criteria across all barcodes, is printed.\n",
        "   - **`else: print(\"No data found matching the criteria.\")`**: If `filtered_dfs` is empty (no barcodes passed the filtering criteria), this message is printed.\n",

Notice the '_x' and '_y' suffixes.  Since the merge involved columns with the same name ('Tumor_Sample_Barcode') from both input DataFrames, pandas automatically appends '_x' and '_y' to distinguish the columns.
